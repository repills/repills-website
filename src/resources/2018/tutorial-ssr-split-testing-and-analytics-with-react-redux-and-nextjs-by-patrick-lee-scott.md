abstract: "In this tutorial we will start with an empty Node.js project and walk through the process of building simple split-testing functionality with Next.js, Redux, and seamless analytics by creating custom Redux analytics middleware. This serves dual-purposes. As an introduction to Redux and Next.js, as well as how to build an actually useful feature using them."
