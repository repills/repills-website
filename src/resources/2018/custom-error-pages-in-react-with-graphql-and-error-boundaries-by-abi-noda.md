abstract: "One challenge I recently ran into while working with GraphQL and React was how to handle errors. As developers, we've likely implemented default 500, 404, and 403 pages in server-rendered applications before, but figuring out how to do this with React and GraphQL is tricky. In this post, I'll talk about how our team approached this problem, the final solution we implemented, and interesting lessons from the GraphQL spec."
