abstract: "In this tutorial, we will discuss the 'render props' design pattern. This design pattern can be a bit of a head scratcher at first and in order to truly grasp how it exactly works, we need a in-depth understanding of the top level React API and how the JSX code we write is converted to javascript. So letâ€™s use a very simple example and walk through what is going on under the hood."
