abstract: "AWS AppSync allows developers to offload the complexity and time involved with building a GraphQL backend and only worry about building their application, and it does so with real-time and offline capabilities. In this post, we'll look at how to create a new AppSync GraphQL API & connect it to a React application. We'll also add mutations, queries, and subscriptions to the application to make the data real-time."
