abstract: "When I started learning React, I was searching for something (a blog, a video, a course, whatever) that didn't only teach me how to write apps in React. I also wanted it to prepare me for interviews. Most of the material I found, concentrated on one or the other. So, this post is aimed towards the audience who is looking for a perfect mix of theory and hands-on. I will give you a little bit of theory so that you understand what is happening under the hood and then I will show you how to write some React.js code."
