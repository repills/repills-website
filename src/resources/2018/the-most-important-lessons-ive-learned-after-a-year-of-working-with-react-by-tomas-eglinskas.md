abstract: "Starting out with a new technology can be quite troublesome. You usually find yourself in a sea of tutorials and articles, followed by millions of personal opinions. And every single one states that they found the 'right and perfect way.' Before diving into the ocean, we must understand the underlying concepts of a technology. Then we need to develop a technology-based mindset. If we are starting to learn React, we first have to think in React. Only later on we can start mixing various mindsets into one. In this article we'll be covering some lessons I learned regarding this mindset from my personal experiences with React."
