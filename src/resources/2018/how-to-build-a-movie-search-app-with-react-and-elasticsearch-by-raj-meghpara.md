abstract: "In this post, we will use React and Elasticsearch to build a MovieSearch app. I know you like React, and watching movies, but what is this Elasticsearch thing I’m talking about. Don’t worry. This blog post will give you a kickstart into understanding the basics of Elasticsearch — What is it? Why should you care about it? And, how can you use it with React to build powerful apps painlessly."
