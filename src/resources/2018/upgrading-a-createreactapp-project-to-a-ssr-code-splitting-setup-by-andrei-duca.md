abstract: "The default CRA setup can be OK for small projects, it's not always enough for larger, more complex applications. Luckily, we can improve things, even without ejecting. Let's try to do this step by step. This is what we'll cover: Server-side rendering, Code splitting with react-loadable, Code splitting on the server, Taking benefit of webpack's chunkNames."
