abstract: "Today, I'm doing just that, using a static Gatsby site, Netlify's Forms, Identity, and Functions features. This tutorial will show you how to add static forms to your site, the user authentication for password-protected content and how to create an AWS Lambda function. Ready to supercharge a static site with serverless features?"
