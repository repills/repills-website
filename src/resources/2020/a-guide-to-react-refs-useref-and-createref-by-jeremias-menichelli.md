abstract: "As is the case with many other UI libraries, React offers a way to rethink a view as the result of a state of a component.  Part of that benefit comes from creating the views with the abstraction mechanisms React and JSX expose instead of doing it through DOM spec methods.  Still, the React team did something smart that all library authors should do: they provided escape hatches and kept the library open for situations beyond the ones they were specifically designed for, as well as situations the model may not work for. In this article, we're going to investigate why React leaves the door open for developers to access it."
