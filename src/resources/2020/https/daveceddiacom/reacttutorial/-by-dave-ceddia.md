abstract: "Learning React is tough. It seems there's a lot to learn at once. You might even think that 'learning React' means that you have to also learn about Redux, Webpack, React Router, CSS in JS, and a pile of other stuff. This article is designed for total beginners to React, as well as folks who've tried to learn in the past but have had a tough time. I think I can help you figure this out.  Here's what we'll cover: What React is and why it's worth learning, How to get something on the page with components and JSX, Passing data to components with props, Making things interactive with state and hooks, Calling an API with useEffect Deploying a standalone React app."
