abstract: "Vue.js is arguably one of the easiest and most minimalist JavaScript frameworks with which to get started. While we cannot downplay the current momentum and volume of developers adapting Vue.js, you will agree with me that there are very few tutorials that cover advanced concepts in Vue. In this tutorial, we will talk about: Vue.js mixins, Custom directives, Filters, Transitions (enter/leave), State management, Server-side rendering"
