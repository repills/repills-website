abstract: "There's a lot of confusion right now about the 'right' way to test your React components. Should you write all your tests by hand, or only use snapshots, or some of both? Should you test props? State? Styles/Layout? I don't think there's one 'right' way, but I've found a few patterns and tips that work really well for me that I'd like to share."
