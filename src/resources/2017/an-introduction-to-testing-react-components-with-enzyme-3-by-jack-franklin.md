abstract: "In today's post we'll introduce the AirBnB library Enzyme for testing React applications. We'll do this using a test driven development (TDD) approach. That is, we'll write the tests first, watch them fail, and then build the React component out to fix the tests, before then writing more. We'll then consider how we can refactor code whilst running the tests to confirm we haven’t made any errors."
