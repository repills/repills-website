abstract: "It has been a pretty long time already that i have been using React and Friends and wanted to share what was one of our biggest pains and how we overcame them — implementing forms. A lot of web applications are form-based, you give the user the ability to use your platform by filling forms and manipulating form components. This obviously raises some questions regarding how to write and use form components in react, and how react and redux play along together."
