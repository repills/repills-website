abstract: "Components help us deal with properties, state, events, and often are responsible for the well-being of other components as well. Keeping track of everything components do sometimes can be tough. To help with this, React provides us with something known as lifecycle methods. Lifecycle methods are (unsurprisingly) special methods that automatically get called as our component goes about its business. They notify us of important milestones in our component's life, and we can use these notifications to simply pay attention or change what our component is about to do. In this tutorial, we are going to look at these lifecycle methods and learn all about what we can do with them."
