abstract: "In this session, we'll cover the basics of working with Vue, how to use the component and some of its offerings to create fluid effects in the browser. We'll move on to watchers, the reactivity system, and transitioning state. Finally, we'll talk about lifecycle methods, SVG, and pushing our animations to the next level."
