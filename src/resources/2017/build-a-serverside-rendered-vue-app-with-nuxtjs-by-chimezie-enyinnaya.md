abstract: "Usage of static websites are increasing in popularity recently. It's not a surprise as static site generators seem to have been gaining more popular recently too. There are various static site generators which you can use to build websites. Some of these generators include Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Nuxt.js to mention but a few. Gatsby and Nuxt.js are pretty new to the collection. In this tutorial, I will be showing how to build a static website with Nuxt.js. For the purpose of demonstration, we'll be building a personal portfolio website."
