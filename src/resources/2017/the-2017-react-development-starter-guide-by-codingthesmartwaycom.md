abstract: "If you would like to start out and make your first steps with React you'll quickly realize that React is easy to learn. However one of the biggest obstacles you'll be confronted with as a React beginner is the tooling and ecosystem. Choosing from the various tooling options and packages is an overwhelming task if you're a React beginner. However, you can avoid this pain by choosing a premade boilerplate for your first React app. In the following tutorial we'll use 'create-react-app' to bootstrap our application. It's an opinionated zero-configuration starter kit for React."
