abstract: "Vue doesn't provide an official way of implementing AJAX, and there are a number of different design patterns that may be used effectively. Each comes with its own pros and cons, and should be judged based on the requirements. You may even use several, simultaneously! In this article, I'll show you four places you can implement AJAX in a Vue app: Root instance, Components, Vuex actions and Route navigation guards. I'll explain each approach, give an example, and cover the pros and cons as well."
