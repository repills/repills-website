abstract: "If you've used Vue with Laravel, you've likely become used to the single file Vue components that just works out of the box. This talk will discuss how we moved from the traditional language-based separation of concern to this new pattern for composing UI in our apps, how this trend is reflected in the bigger frontend scene as a whole, and some technical details on how all the magic happens under the hood."
