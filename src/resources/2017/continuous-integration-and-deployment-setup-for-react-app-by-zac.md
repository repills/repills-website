abstract: "This article aims to help developers build a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment stack for React app. We will be using CircleCI, CodeClimate and Heroku. At the end, we would have a React app in a Github Repo that will automatically deploy any changes on master branch to Heroku after all tests passes."
