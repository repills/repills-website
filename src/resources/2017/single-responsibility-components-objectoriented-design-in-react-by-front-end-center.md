abstract: "The Functional Programming (FP) aspects of React are fairly prominent, but components themselves are an example of Object-Oriented (OO) programming. In this episode, we'll look at how one idea from OO—The Single Responsibility Principle—can help us design and extract more readable, reusable, and maintainable React components."
