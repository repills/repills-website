abstract: "The goal of this guide is to share the core principles of how to use styled-components in a server side rendered React application. The beauty of styled-components really shines through when you realize how seamless it is to setup in your application. Furthermore, styled-components are easy to integrate into existing applications that are using other methods of styling. In this guide there are no additional libraries such as Redux, React Router, or concepts such as code splitting — let's start with the basics."
