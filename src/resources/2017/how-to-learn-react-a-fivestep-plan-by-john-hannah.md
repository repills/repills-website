abstract: "For the past two+ years I've worked exclusively on React projects and I've had my own up-and-down learning experience with it. Over that time, I've developed some advice for how to learn Reactâ€”the resources, the sequence and the important takeaways. What follows is a five-step plan for learning React. All of the steps point you to free resources whenever possible."
