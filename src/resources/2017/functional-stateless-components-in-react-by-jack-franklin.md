abstract: "React 0.14 introduced functional, stateless components as a way to define React components as a function, rather than as an ES2015 class or via React.createClass. They are cleaner, have the potential to be more performant as React develops, and encourage good patterns in your React codebase that will lead to a more maintainable application as it grows."
