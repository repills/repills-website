abstract: "The redux-form library bills itself as the best way to manage your form state in Redux. It provides a higher-order form component and a collection of container components for dealing with forms in a React and Redux powered application. Most importantly, it makes it easy to get a form up and running with state management and validations baked in. This article give you a solid foundation for getting redux-form set up with create-react-app, building out a simple form, adding validations, and responding to a form submission."
