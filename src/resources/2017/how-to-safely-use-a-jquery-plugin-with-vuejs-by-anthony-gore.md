abstract: "It's not a great idea to use jQuery and Vue.js in the same UI. Don't do it if you can avoid it. But you're probably reading this not because you want to use jQuery and Vue together, but because you have to. Perhaps a client is insisting on using a particular jQuery plugin that you wonâ€™t have time to rewrite for Vue. If you're careful about how you do it, you can use jQuery and Vue together safely. In this article I'm going to demonstrate how to add the jQuery UI Datepicker plugin to a Vue project."
