abstract: "As you work on a React application it's highly likely that you'll encounter components that have grown over time. They may have started with just one particular use case in mind, but will have been added to since. This can lead to complex render methods and code that's hard to follow. In this video you'll see how to spot components that need some work doing, how we test these components, and how we use the tests to guide us, splitting one component into two much more straightforward ones."
