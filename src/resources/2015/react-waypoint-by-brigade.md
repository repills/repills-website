abstract: "A React component to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element. Works in all containers that can scroll, including the window. React Waypoint can be used to build features like lazy loading content, infinite scroll, scrollspies, or docking elements to the viewport on scroll. Inspired by Waypoints, except this little library grooves the React way."
