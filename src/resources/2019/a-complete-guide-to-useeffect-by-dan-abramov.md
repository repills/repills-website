abstract: "Sometimes when you useEffect, the pieces don't quite fit together. You have a nagging feeling that you're missing something. It seems similar to class lifecycles… but is it really? The goal of this article isn't to give you a list of bullet point recipes. It's to help you truly “grok” useEffect. There won't be much to learn. In fact, we'll spend most of our time unlearning."
