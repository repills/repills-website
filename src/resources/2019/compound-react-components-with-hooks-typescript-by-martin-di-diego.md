abstract: "When writing React components, it always pays off to spend a little bit of time thinking about how another developer would use them. In this post, I'd like to dive a bit into Compound Components, a pattern for creating components that I've found to be a joy to use both as a creator and consumer. We'll be creating a small <Tabs> component with TypeScript and Context Hooks."
