abstract: "I want to learn React… but what should I build? Front end coding is a skill. Well, maybe more like a bundle of skills. JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, build tools, command line usage… there's a lot to know! Like any skill, you need practice before you dive in and build the next Facebook. The best practice comes from concrete projects that you can start and finish."
