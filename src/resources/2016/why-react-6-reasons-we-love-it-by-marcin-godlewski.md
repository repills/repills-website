abstract: "With the front-end world changing on a daily basis, it's hard hard to devote time to learning a new framework â€“ especially when that framework could ultimately become a dead end. So if you're looking for the next best thing but you're feeling a little bit lost in the framework jungle, I suggest checking out React. Here you yill find why we're re-building our GUI in React, and why you might want to consider it as the basis of your next project."
