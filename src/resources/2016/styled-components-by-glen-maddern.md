abstract: "Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier! styled-components is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps!"
