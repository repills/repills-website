abstract: "Next.js is an awesome new framework for building universal React applications. In simple terms, that means you can use React to render templates on the server, as well frontend components the way you're most likely used to. The advantages of this are numerous (shared components, faster rendering, great tooling), but getting it all to work properly is generally a pain.Next.js makes this process easy, and with the release of V3 I thought I'd whip up a blog to learn and demonstrate how it works. In this tutorial we'll be using the following: next (3.X), styled-components (phenomenal css-in-js solution), next-routes (middleware for expressive routes in next), express (for serving our pages, although you can also do static exports)."
