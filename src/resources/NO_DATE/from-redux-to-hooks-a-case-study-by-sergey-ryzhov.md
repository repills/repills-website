title: "From Redux to Hooks: A Case Study"
author: "Sergey Ryzhov"
abstract: "Using Hooks instead of Redux for state management is by no means easier.  You have to be already familiar with the underlying concepts and understand the tradeoffs. Without relying on Redux you lose out-of-the-box performance optimizations, middleware support, devtools extension, time travel debugging and a bunch of other things.  On the other hand you can noticeably reduce boilerplate and make iterations faster.  After several years of using Redux for most of our projects we decided to try useReducer/useContext approach instead. Here is what we learned."
